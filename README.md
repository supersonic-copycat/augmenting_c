While there are plenty of guides how to integrate Lua into C
I tried to
* somehow update nice [GNU Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/docs/guile-tut/tutorial.html) tutorial
* do the same task, but with Lua to compare these two
I hope it would be of use for people interested in beginner-level (C) programming.

History in this repo is edited heavily, but I tried to highlight all the issues I ran into and show solutions.
